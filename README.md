# Dictionary-web-app
This project will take some time, however I will have only 2 weeks to finish this project. 

<!-- Finish the website. Still need to add the rest of the difinition and add the final touches regarding the aesthetics of the dictionary.  -->

<!-- I need to remove the noun and verb sections, because the words entered in the search bar might not a verb or a noun. I need to have it automated to check whether the word is a verb, noun, adjective or adverb and display the info correctly. -->

Found a solution for the problem and on the path to finishing the project.

Finished tthe project, however there is a setback, the project will have errors if there is audio for the word. 
Need to readjust the program.

### Issues
 
 Couldn't change the background of the book icon to suit the background color of the website. (Fixed it, just changed the image to one that can change.)

 Couldn't change the color of the font in the input tag.

 If there is missing audio the program will crash.

### Prefrences 
Reflect the moon icon. (Done)
